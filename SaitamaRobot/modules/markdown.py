Markdown is a very powerful formatting tool supported by telegram. @RajniiRobot has some enhancements, to make sure that 
saved messages are correctly parsed, and to allow you to create buttons.
• italic: wrapping text with '_' will produce italic text
• bold: wrapping text with '*' will produce bold text
• code or monospace: wrapping text with '`' will produce monospaced text, also known as code
• [sometext] (url): this will create a link - the message will just show sometext, 
and tapping on it will open the page at given url in (). (Without space between [] & ())

• Inline Button:
Contact @RajniSupport to know about how to make
 Inline Url button.
